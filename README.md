# Student-Management-System-using-Python

🚀 Built a Student Grades Management System using Python!

Managing student records manually? Let's automate it! 🎯

I recently built a Student Grades Management System that allows users to:

✅ Add, update, and delete student records

✅ View all students in a structured format

✅ Handle invalid inputs gracefully

🔹 Tech Stack: Python 🐍 | Dictionaries | Exception Handling

🔹 Real-World Use: Schools, universities, or even HR systems!




📌 Steps in the Flowchart
1️⃣ Start the Program

2️⃣ Display Menu Options

3️⃣ User Chooses an Option (1-5)

(1) Add Student → Enter name & grade → Store in dictionary
(2) Update Student → Check if student exists → Update grade
(3) Delete Student → Check if student exists → Remove from dictionary
(4) View All Students → Display stored students
(5) Exit Program
4️⃣ Handle Invalid Input
5️⃣ Repeat Until User Chooses Exit
